# DRAW7.1 C Source


This was my very first program started in TurboC then moved to Borland C 3.1 and version 4.5. I wanted to be able to make sprites for a game. How better to learn then to make a draw program first. So the release is in the GCDraw folder with Docs and samples. The base directory has tons on samples. It has some cool features like layout mode and there's an exe to convery your sprites to a format.

This is really old, the source is there and the release. 

I still load it from time to time to see all the sprites I made.

Check it out 

Thanks
RC
