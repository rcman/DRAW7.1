Thank You for downloading GCDraw. GCDraw was a tool I developed to help me
create DOS based graphics and backgrounds for games. This version of GCDraw
allows objects that are 16x16 and the next version will support 32x32. GCDraw
was originally intended as a tool for myself, searching the Web and BBS's 
I never really found what suited my needs. I decided to write my own
with very basic data saves and ease of use to create object for animation
or backgrounds. You'll find some examples included and the program is fully
functional. Enjoy.

Basically put GCDRAW.ZIP in your desired directory and use -d in PKUNZIP 
to create the DOC and SAMPLES directories.

                        PKUNZIP -d GCDRAW.ZIP
